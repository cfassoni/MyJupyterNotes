# My Jupyter Notes

This repository stores some pieces of algorithms and procedures that I developed along more than 20 years working in telecommunications engineering and software development.

As part of my own development in Python, I decided to port them to Python 3 using the beatiful Jupyter Notebook to manage all notes and codes.

# Where you Start

If you are new to Python or even in programming in any language, I suggest you begin reading the following books.
They are great and give a nice jump start:

- A Whirlwind Tour of Python by [Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/pages/about.html) (O'Reilly Media, 2016)
- The Python Data Science Handbook by [Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/pages/about.html) (O'Reilly Media, 2016)

Both can be read directly from Professor Jake's web page or forked as Jupyter Notebooks from his [Github](https://github.com/jakevdp). Of course, if you like them, consider buying from you prefered book store.

# What you Need

Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks - I suggest you download and install Anaconda or Miniconda on you system. Instructions can be found on the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) web site or simply search for tutorials and videos in the web - there are a lot!
For reference, the notebooks in this repository were created using Anaconda 3 64 bit (Python 3.5) on Windows 10.

# Free to Participate

You're welcome to participate, fork, contribute and reuse the code as you wish.
Please don't forget to give the due credits.
