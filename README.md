# My Jupyter Notes

This repository stores some pieces of algorithms and procedures that I developed along more than 20 years working in telecommunications engineering and software development.

As part of my own development in Python, I decided to port then to Python using the beatiful Jupyter Notebook to manage all notes and codes.

# Where you Start

If you are new to Python or even in programming in any language, I suggest you begin reading the following (free) books.
They are great and give a nice jump start:

- A Whirlwind Tour of Python by Jake VanderPlas (O'Reilly Media, 2016)
- The Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas (O'Reilly Media, 2016)

Both can be read directly from Professor Jake's web page (https://jakevdp.github.io/pages/about.html) or forked as Jupyter Notebooks. Of course, if you like, consider buying from you book store.

# What you Need

Python and Jupyter Notebooks - I suggest you download and install Anaconda or Miniconda on you system.
The notebooks in this repository were created using Anaconda 3 64 bit (Python 3.5) on Windows 10.

# Free to Participate

You're welcome to participate, fork, contribute and reuse the code as you give the right credits.
