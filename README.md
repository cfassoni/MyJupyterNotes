# My Jupyter Notes

This repository stores some pieces of algorithms and procedures that I developed along more than 20 years working in telecommunications engineering and software development.

As part of my own development in Python, I decided to port then to Python using the beatiful Jupyter Notebook to manage all notes and codes.

You're welcome to participate, fork, contribute and reuse the code as you give the right credits.

# New to Python?

I suggest you begin reading the following (free) books. They are great and give a nice jump start:

- [A Whirlwind Tour of Python] (https://jakevdp.github.io/pages/about.html) by Jake VanderPlas (O'Reilly Media, 2016)
- [The Python Data Science Handbook] (https://jakevdp.github.io/pages/about.html) by Jake VanderPlas (O'Reilly Media, 2016)
